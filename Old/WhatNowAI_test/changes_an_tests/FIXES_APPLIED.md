# WhatNowAI Fixes Applied

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed User Profiling Error
**Issue**: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'items'`
**Solution**: 
- Added proper null checks for all user profile data
- Added fallback empty dictionaries/lists when data is None
- Enhanced error handling in profile creation

### 2. Removed AllEvents API Integration
**Issue**: All endpoints returning 404 errors
**Actions taken**:
- Removed all AllEvents service imports
- Removed AllEvents service initialization
- Removed AllEvents API calls from routes
- Moved `allevents_service_enhanced.py` to trash
- Updated health check endpoint
- Removed AllEvents from event discovery logs

### 3. Fixed Fallback Event Error
**Issue**: `'dict' object has no attribute 'id'`
**Solution**:
- Created `add_generic_event()` method in mapping service
- Changed from using `add_allevents_events()` to `add_generic_event()` for fallback events
- Added proper error handling for individual event additions

### 4. Improved Location Detection

- Fixed `geocode()` method call to `geocode_address()`
- Added more fallback options for city detection (suburb, neighbourhood)
- Added state/county extraction with fallbacks
- Added neighbourhood and road information to geocoding results
- Improved location data structure with more fields

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Working:
- Text-to-speech guidance
- Location detection and geocoding (improved)
- Ticketmaster event discovery
- Fallback event sources (Eventbrite, Facebook, Yelp, etc.)
- Interactive mapping
- User profiling (with proper error handling)
- OSINT search capabilities

### ‚ùå Removed:
- AllEvents API (persistent 404 errors)

### üîß Fixed Issues:
- No more NoneType errors in user profiling
- No more dict attribute errors for fallback events
- Geocoding now works for both forward and reverse lookups
- Better location accuracy with more fallback options

## Testing Results
The application now starts without errors and all core features are functional. The system gracefully handles missing data and provides fallback functionality.
